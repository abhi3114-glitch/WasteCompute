# WasteCompute - Demo Script

## For Imagine Cup Judges

**Duration**: 5 minutes

---

## 1. Opening (30 sec)

> "Every year, $30 billion worth of compute sits idle in enterprise data centers. WasteCompute turns that waste into revenue—and that's good for business AND the planet."

**Action**: Show landing page with 3D CPU/GPU visualization

---

## 2. The Problem (30 sec)

> "Enterprises buy for peak capacity, but peak only happens 20% of the time. The rest? Wasted electricity, wasted money, wasted hardware."

**Action**: Point to the headline "Monetize your idle infrastructure"

---

## 3. The Solution (1 min)

> "WasteCompute is a secure marketplace. Enterprises list their idle capacity, buyers submit workloads, everyone wins."

**Actions**:
1. Click "Start Selling" → Dashboard
2. Click "Provision Node" → Show real hardware detection
3. Point out CPU%, RAM, GPU name (your actual hardware!)

---

## 4. Live Demo - CPU Execution (1 min)

> "Let's run a job on CPU."

**Actions**:
1. Select "CPU" from dropdown
2. Click "Execute"
3. Show console output: `[CPU EXECUTION]`
4. Show job history with green "CPU" badge

---

## 5. Live Demo - GPU Execution (1 min)

> "Now let's run the same job on GPU."

**Actions**:
1. Select "GPU" from dropdown
2. Click "Execute"
3. Show console output: `[GPU EXECUTION]`
4. Show job history with cyan "GPU" badge

---

## 6. Billing & Persistence (30 sec)

> "Every job is tracked and billed. And if I restart the server..."

**Actions**:
1. Click "Invoices" → Show billing table
2. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
3. Restart server
4. Refresh dashboard → Jobs still there!

---

## 7. Closing (30 sec)

> "WasteCompute: reducing waste, democratizing compute, one idle server at a time. Thank you."

## Key Talking Points

- **SDG 9**: Democratizing compute access
- **SDG 12**: Extending hardware lifecycle
- **SDG 13**: Reducing energy waste
- **Real Business Model**: 15% transaction fee
- **Technical Depth**: Sandbox isolation, SQLite persistence, hardware detection
