        <h1>WasteCompute</h1>
        <p class="version">Official Product Documentation — Version 1.0</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>WasteCompute is a distributed compute marketplace that enables enterprises to monetize unused CPU and GPU
            capacity. The platform securely exposes idle compute windows to verified buyers, allowing execution of
            approved workloads under strict isolation and policy enforcement.</p>

        <h2>2. Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Enterprises significantly overprovision compute resources to handle peak workloads. During off-peak periods,
            a large percentage of this infrastructure remains idle, resulting in substantial financial waste. Existing
            tools focus on monitoring or cost reporting, but none enable safe resale of unused compute capacity.</p>

        <h2>3. Solution</h2>
        <p>WasteCompute introduces a secure compute exchange where idle enterprise infrastructure can be temporarily
            allocated to external workloads. The platform ensures strong isolation, policy-driven execution, and
            real-time risk controls, transforming unused capacity into revenue.</p>

        <h2>4. System Architecture</h2>
        <p>The system consists of four primary components: Enterprise Agent, Marketplace Scheduler, Secure Execution
            Runtime, and Billing & Audit Layer. The Enterprise Agent detects idle compute windows and publishes
            availability metadata. The Scheduler matches buyer workloads to available resources. The Runtime enforces
            sandboxing, time limits, and security policies. The Billing Layer tracks usage and handles settlements.</p>

        <h2>5. Security Model</h2>
        <p>All workloads execute within isolated environments using hardware-backed security. Network access is
            restricted by default. Data persistence is disabled unless explicitly permitted. Workloads are terminated
            automatically upon policy violation or time expiration.</p>

        <h2>6. GPU Features</h2>
        <p>WasteCompute provides first-class GPU support for AI/ML workloads. Features include CUDA and ROCm runtime
            compatibility, VRAM monitoring and allocation controls, multi-GPU job distribution, and priority queuing for
            GPU-intensive tasks. Supported hardware includes NVIDIA datacenter GPUs (A100, H100, RTX 4090/5090) and AMD
            Instinct accelerators.</p>

        <h2>7. Revenue Model</h2>
        <p>WasteCompute operates on a marketplace take-rate model. Enterprises earn revenue from sold compute hours,
            while WasteCompute retains a percentage as platform fees. Additional enterprise plans provide enhanced
            security controls, compliance reporting, and priority scheduling.</p>

        <h2>8. Target Customers</h2>
        <p>Primary sellers include enterprises, universities, research institutions, and data centers. Primary buyers
            include AI startups, research labs, analytics teams, and simulation workloads requiring cost-effective
            compute resources.</p>

        <h2>9. Compliance and Governance</h2>
        <p>The platform supports audit logs, workload traceability, and policy enforcement suitable for enterprise and
            regulatory requirements. All executions are fully logged for forensic review.</p>

        <h2>10. Future Roadmap</h2>
        <p>Planned enhancements include dynamic pricing models, GPU partitioning support, regional compliance controls,
            and deeper integration with cloud and on-prem orchestration systems.</p>
